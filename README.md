# Introduction

Enterprises today are exploring ways to upgrade existing applications to harvest value from **machine learning**. Business have lots of structured and unstructured data already. Machine learning is not a one time activity where you train a model and  it can live forever. There are things such as concept drift that makes the model stale. The stale model has to be minimally periodically retrained with fresh batch of data. To continue to get value out of machine learning models we need an architecture and process in place to repeatedly and consistently train new models and retrain existing models with new data.

In the workshop, we will discuss how you can build an end to end pipeline for machine learning. Machine learning is more than building a cool model. It involves tasks that includes data sourcing, data ingestion, data transformation, pre-processing data for use in training, training a model and hosting the model.

AWS provides several services to address specific needs of different stages of machine learning pipeline. The workshop have multiple labs that focus on different stages of machine learning pipeline. We will be demonstrating the overall flow and design of machine learning pipeline by using movie-lens dataset to build a recommendation engine for movies. 

The workshop is divided into four labs.  In **Lab 1**, we will source the movie-lens dataset from external source on internet, bring it to S3 and upload it into Dynamo DB. In enterprises the equivalent data may be already  present in some RDS, NoSQL or Data-warehouse system. The data can be ingested as a one time full-load as a batch or as a real-time stream of data. 

Depending on the usecase, there may be a need to do both batch and stream or just a batch or a stream. In the current workshop, we will do a one full-load of data into Dynamo DB and then replay new records into Kinesis stream using the Lamda function as a source simulator. Each lab has references to resources and instruction to help you complete the lab successfully.

The labs are **sequential** and participants will have to complete them in the sequence.


## Reference Architecture
![Reference Architecture](./images/reference-architecture.png)

## **Lab 1 - Use DMS to copy data from S3 to DyanamoDB**

### Prerequisites and assumptions

To complete this lab, you need an AWS account that provides access to AWS services.

The resources will be created using cloud formation. The cloud formation templates are agnostic of an AWS region in which they are executed. The only pre-condition is that all the services that are required for end to end solution are available in the region that you choose to work.

The cloud formation can be executed in two modes. 

You can choose to run CloudFormation templates one by one manully in sequence. In total five CloudFormation templates are required to build the full DMS stack to move data from source to target. The sequence number is indicated in the suffix of CloudFormation templates yaml files. Running five CloudFormation templates i.e. <filename>-001.yaml - <filename>-005.yaml will  create the full DMS stack and will also start the DMS replication task. 

The second way to create full DMS stack is to run the dms-full-stack-nested.yaml file that will automatically run the five CloudFormation templates i.e <filename>-001.yaml - <filename>-005.yaml sequentially without manual intervention.

For this workshop we will go with second option. Run one nested CloudFormation template to create full DMS stack. Follow steps outlined below to create full DMS stack. The output of this step will be four dynamo Db tables populated with movie-lens data. You will see 5th table named <exceptions> with now records.

### List of resoucres

We will provision following resources using CloudFormation templates:

1. Amazon S3 bucket to hold movielens data.
2. IAM roles to provide access to Database Migration Service to access and provision other AWS resources
4. VPC, Subnet, Internet Gateway and Security Group to provisio DMS Replication Instances.
5. DMS replication instance and DMS tasks
6. Lambda function to copy movie-lens data from external source into S3 bucket in the account.
7. Lambda function to start DMS task replication.

Congrats!! You have successfully completed Lab 1

# **Lab 2 - Stream Data with Kinesis**

In this Lab, we will setup setup a Lambda function to push user rating data into Kinesis data stream and then use Amazon Kinesis Firehose to export data to S3. The Lambda function will simulate user generated real time ratings data. Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. By using Kinesis, we can store real time data data update our machine learning model. Kinesis supports multiple consumers for its data streams so another consumer can be setup to process data and store it into DynamoDB.


## 1. Create an Amazon Kinesis stream

   1. Sign into the AWS management console.
   2. In the upper right hand of the console make sure you are in the desired region (eg: N Virginia)
   3. Click on kinesis from the list of services. You will arrive on the kinesis dashboard.
   4. On the Kinesis Dashboard, click **Data Stream** on the left panel and then click **Create** **Kinesis Stream**. If you do not see the panel but a welcome page, go ahead and click “**Get Started**”.
    ![](images/kinesis-001.png)
   5. For Kinesis stream name, enter YourInitials_stream. Enter 1 for Number of Shards. Click on create Kinesis stream. The stream will be on creating status. Wait for stream to be in **ACTIVE** status.

     ![](images/firehose-001.png)
     
   5.	For Delivery stream name, enter YourInitials_firehosestream. In the Source option field, choose Kinesis stream and in the Kinesis stream drop down, select the stream created in previous section. Click Next
     ![](images/firehose-002.png)
     
   6. In the Process records page, choose Disabled. Note that Amazon Kinesis Firehose provides the capability through Lambda to transform the source data before loading them into the destination datasource. 
    ![](images/firehose-004.png)
   7. Click Next.
   8. Choose Amazon S3 as the Destination. For S3 bucket, choose the bucket that was created for you Lab 1. The bucket name should be a number (aws account #) ending with reinvent-2018-data. Specify **firehose** as the prefix and click next.
    ![](images/firehose-006.png)
   9. On **Configure Settings** select to create a new IAM and click on **Allow**. Click Next and choose **Create delivery stream**
    ![](images/firehose-007.png)

##  3. Create AWS Lambda function to load data into stream

1. Sign into the AWS management console.
2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, confirm you are in the desired AWS region (e.g., N. Virginia).
3. Click on Lambda from the list of all services. This will bring you to the AWS Lambda dashboard page.

![](images/lambda-005.png)

10. Click Save on the top right hand corner of the screen and then click Test. Since we are not providing any parameter or input values, leave everything default, give it a name **Test**, and click Create. 

![](images/lambda-006.png)

11. The function will run 8 minutes to put rating data into the Kinesis stream. Note you may get a timeout error, this is normal as the function timed out (8 mins) before it could push all records. Continue to next step.
12. So far, we have a Kinesis stream and we have created the Lambda function to put ratings records into the stream. We also setup Kinesis Firehose to retrieve the data in the stream and store them in a S3 bucket. To verify everything is working, go to the S3 bucket and verify the data files exist. Note Kinesis Firehose stores data in a year/month/date folder.

# **Lab 3 - Create an AWS Glue Job**

In Lab 2, you used Kinesis to collect and store real time ratings data into S3. In this Lab, you will use Glue Data Catalog to define schema on the data stored in S3 and DynamoDB. You will perform ETL on the data to prepare it for the machine learning process. The output data from Glue will be used at input to the Amazon Sagemaker notebook.

## 1. Populate the S3 Glue data catalog

1. The AWS Glue Data Catalog is an index to the location, schema, and runtime metrics of your data. It contains references to data that is used as sources and targets of your extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs in AWS Glue. The Data Catalog is a drop-in replacement for the Apache Hive Meta-store and provides a uniform repository where disparate systems can store and find metadata to keep track of data, and use that metadata to query and transform the data. To populate the data catalog, we need to first create a role with proper permissions and then a crawler to take inventory of the data in our S3 bucket and Dynadb tables.
